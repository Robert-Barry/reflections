When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

You want to use a remote repository when working on code with others, or 
possibly when working on a different computer from the one where the project
was created. This allows the project to be shared over multiple devices and with
multiple people, adding a lot of flexibility to the repository.



*******************************************************************************

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The biggest issue is when working with others. If someone else changes the
repository before you have a chance to pull for yourself, you may wind up
with wild conflicts that could create a ton of problems. You might also
lose the data thet you were working on by automatically pulling from GitHub.



*******************************************************************************

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks allow a person on GitHub to have a copy of a repository that retains
a link to the original repository withouy making changes in the original.
A clone is a wholesale copy of a repository without any attribution. A branch
is a new commit off of the main tree of the repository that can be merged
back into the main part. Use a fork to make a copy while attributing the
author of the orignal code, use clone to bring a repository onto your own
computer from GitHub, and use a branch when making small adjustments to your
own repository that you do not want affecting the main code.



*******************************************************************************

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

Having a copy of the remote branch stord locally allows one to compare the local
and remote branches, as well as keep track of how the branches are deviating
when commiting to the local branch.
