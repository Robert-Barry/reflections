When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

You want to use a remote repository when working on code with others, or 
possibly when working on a different computer from the one where the project
was created. This allows the project to be shared over multiple devices and with
multiple people, adding a lot of flexibility to the repository.



*******************************************************************************

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The biggest issue is when working with others. If someone else changes the
repository before you have a chance to pull for yourself, you may wind up
with wild conflicts that could create a ton of problems. You might also
lose the data thet you were working on by automatically pulling from GitHub.
