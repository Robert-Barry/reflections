When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You want to use a remote repository when working on code with others, or possibly when
working on a different computer from the one where the project was created. This allows
the project to be shared over multiple devices and with multiple people, adding a lot
of flexibility to the repository.
