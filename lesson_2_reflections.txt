What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized, it creates a repository for all the files
in the folder. You do this so that you can begin to create commits on those
files and start keeping track of all the versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is for commits that haven't happened yet, where the working
directory is for the actual files, and the repository is a place to store all
of the commits. The staging are is valuable in case you change your mind in 
making a commit and decide to not do so. It also works as a check to make sure
you are commiting all of the files you want to commit, and not commiting files
you do not want to.
